# Vuilder Hackathon Bounty: Community Quota Bank

## Purpose

The Vite ecosystem needs a community funded quota bank so that:
1. Individuals can get more quota than if they only staked Vite by themselves
2. Vite holders have another option to earn dividends with their Vite
3. Dapps and their users have a quick way to get more quota during times of unexpectedly high usage

## Features
- Users can pay for quota with $VQ - the [token](https://docs.vite.org/vite-docs/reference/mintage.html) owned and issued by the contract
- The contract rewards users $VQ over time as their Vite is still staked (3 day minimum)
- Users can send their $VQ to the contract which burns the $VQ and uses the Vite in the contract to stake for the user's beneficiary address

## Prizes
- $3000 in Vite

## Contract Requirements
- Uses Solidity++ 0.8
- Unit tests for all contract functionality using [ViteJS](https://github.com/vitelabs/vite.js "https://github.com/vitelabs/vite.js") and your unit testing library of choice
- Contract should include:
	- TODO
	- Additional properties that you can think of are welcome

## Judging Criteria
- The Vite Labs team will check to make sure all of the requirements have been met
- Consolation prizes will be given for submissions that are good, but donâ€™t meet all requirements
- If your submission is close to completion, but requires minor improvements, we may reach out to you to discuss revisions with you so you can get the full bounty prize.

## Winner Announcement
- After the hackathon, we will announce the winner(s) when all submissions have been reviewed and the judge's scores tabulated.
