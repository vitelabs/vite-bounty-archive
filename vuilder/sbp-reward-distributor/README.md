# Vuilder Hackathon Bounty: SBP Reward Distributor

## Purpose
The Vite ecosystem needs a tool for SBPs to distribute their block creation	and votes rewards. This will:
1. Enable more equitable Vite inflation distribution
2. Give Vite holders more opportunities to earn yield
3. Increase community engagement

## Minimum Requirements
1. Existing nodes can run this program on the same machine
2. Keeps track of votes by address, amount, and time/history.
3. SBP operators can define several parameters including:
	1. Distribution frequency
	2. Minimum distribution size for specific addresses
	3. A mechanism that gives loyal voters more rewards
	4. Additional tokens to distribute to voters
	5. Customizable cronjob/hooks that are passed current voting stats as arguments (e.g. an SBP operator could write a script that tweets when certain milestones or events happen)
	6. An option to write a script that gives the SBP operator full control over how rewards are distributed (overwriting some of the settings above)
	7. Optional RPC API for fetching voting stats
4.
