# Open Task

## Goal

Participants can define their own tasks. We broadly categorize all tasks into the following 3 types: infrastructure, application, and ViteX. Below are a few examples for each type as a reference; feel free to come up with your own ideas!

### Infrastructure Examples
- General improvement of the Vite protocol
- EVM compatibility
- Asynchronous Smart Contract programming language specification and compiler implementation
- IDE: Remix / Truffle integration
- Mobile Wallet (Android / iOS)
- DAO tools
- Buf identification/fixes

### Application Examples
- Payment gateways
- Prediction market
- Social wallet
- Vanity addresses

### ViteX Examples
- Custodial gateways (based on Rosetta API)
- On-chain VX dividend distributing
- Light-weight REST/Websocket API for ViteX
- Trading bots (based on Hummingbot)


## Prizes

| Prize Tiers | Prize Amount | Criteria |
|-|-|-|
| Top Prize | $20,000 in VITE | Exceptional in all three angels: Usability, Rigor, and Creativity |
| Second Prize | $2,000 in VITE | Great MVP, demonstrated usability, disciplined tech rigor, and thoughtful creativity |
| Third Prize | $500 in VITE | Viable concept and usability, disciplined tech rigor, and thoughtful creativity |

## Judging Criteria
- Consolation prizes will be given for submissions that are good, but donâ€™t meet all requirements
- If your submission is close to completion, but requires minor improvements, we may reach out to you to discuss revisions with you so you can get the full bounty prize.
- All prizes will be awarded based on the quality of submissions. If no submission meets the expectations of a certain prize tier, Vite Labs reserves the right to withhold rewarding a prize for that tier. In general, we evaluate a submission from three angles: usability, rigor, and creativity.

### Usability
- Generally speaking, a top-ranked entry serves a compelling use case.
- If the submission is a product, a top-ranked entry has a strong value proposition with clear user adoption (perhaps as validated by existing products).
- If the submission is in infrastructure development, a top-ranked entry addresses an important need or solves a critical problem for the Vite network

### Rigor
- A top-ranked entry demonstrates strong technical proficiency
- Code is clean, organized, extensible, and well tested.

### Creativity
- Bonus points for finding a niche (but useful) problem or devising a creative way to solve a problem

## Submission Requirements
- All submissions must be open source for future use and reference by the community
- Links to external documents must be provided in the Github repo submission
- Submissions should be easy to test locally (e.g. `npm i && npm run start`)
- Submissions should have unit tests when applicable

## Winner Announcement
- After the hackathon, we will announce the winner(s) when all submissions have been reviewed and the judge's scores tabulated.
