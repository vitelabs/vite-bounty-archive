- The person may have put in a lot of effort, but the UI is ugly and the UX complex
- My vision of the UI would be a lot simpler
	- THere are a lot of pages in this figma


More notes:
- Overall the design is ok, but in comparison to other dapps like https://app.uniswap.org/, https://curve.fi/, or https://app.anchorprotocol.com/, your design lacks consistency/cohesiveness.

Homepage:
- white circles with text in them don't match the surrounding aesthetic
- Hamburger menu is almost as bold as the Vite logo (no hierarchy)
- The "Mint" button doesn't make sense since it's the homepage and an account isn't even connected

Connect to wallet page:
- An entire page shouldn't be needed to connect to a dapp (see aforementioned dapps as examples)
- The hamburger menu opening up to show Terms and Conditions, Contact us, About us, and theme toggle is very unusual.
- "Mobile" and "QR code" should not be two separate buttons. You need the mobile app to scan the QR code

Bonding curve/Token page:
- These look functional but it lacks hierarchy/consistency
- Link logos are all in different style - should all be flat icons for example
- THe graph for the bonding curve is hard to see (thin, low contrast)

Mint/Sell page:
- Too much empty space. So much so it could probably fit on the page with the graph.
