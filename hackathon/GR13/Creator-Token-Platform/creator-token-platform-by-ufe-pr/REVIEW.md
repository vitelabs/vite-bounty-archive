- `IterableMap` is from https://solidity-by-example.org/app/iterable-mapping/
	- Fine but I wish he gave credit to the original author
- unclear function signature: `function _calculateInversePrice(address _token, uint256 _price, bool _reversed) public view returns (uint256 _amount, uint256 _excess) {`
