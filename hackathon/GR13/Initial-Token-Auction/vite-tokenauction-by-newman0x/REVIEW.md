- This contract has an `administrator` for some reason - easy to remove
- `_sortBids` uses bubble sort - one of the most inefficient sorting algorithms
	- tbf I think the other submissions used a similar sorting method
- `placeBid` allows addresses to add to their current bid but doesn't allow for multiple bids. This is kinda weird.
