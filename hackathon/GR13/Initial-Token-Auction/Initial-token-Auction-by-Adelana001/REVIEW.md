- has light and dark modes
- cluttered UI
- doesn't look good


Landing page:
- Twitter, Discord, GitHub, and Telegram images are too big
- Can barely see the github image
- The headline should be about the dapp, not Vite.
- white circles with text look out of place and unrefined

Log in pages:
- Same issues with the creator token design

auction page:
- Vite and the headline below it take up too much space (1/3 of the page height)
- The screen real estate that is used for interacting with the dapp look crammed
