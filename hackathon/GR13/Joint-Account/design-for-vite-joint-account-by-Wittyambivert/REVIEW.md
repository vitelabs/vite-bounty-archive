- Design looks alright
- UX well thought out
- has Wallet Connect and MetaMask buttons for some reason
- Joint account members have appear to have a message button - idk y
- Missing custom logo (ok, I didn't say "custom logo" but I thought that was implied since everything else is custom)
- Some text is false (e.g. "Use any network of your choice")
- Landing page has a footer that looks a lot like vite.org's and wtih links that presumably go nowhere
- No log out button
- "Family Trust" button has a down arrow indicating a dropdown that expands to nothing?
- Overall the design has potential!
