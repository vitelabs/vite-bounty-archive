For future open tasks, participants should ask if their submission would even be eligible for a prize because most of these submission are really bad. With the other bounties, the structure and rules are very well defined, so the goal for winning was very obvious. We should also make it a requirement that all frontends be built with TypeScript, React, Tailwind CSS, and react-router-dom. I realize this may limit the developer pool, but this also means it's easier to maintain project because the code bases would all have a similar structure.
