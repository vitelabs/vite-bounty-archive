- Most of the contracts are copy/pasted from OpenZeppelin
	- The `NFTMarketplace` contract looks functional with bid/offer/etc functionality, but this only applies to itself. It doesn't act as a marketplace for any 7erc-21 contract.
- This is a marketplace for a single NFT collection
	- This isn't like OpenSea where any collection can be traded
- The frontend mixes material-ui and tailwind
	- This is a bad idea, just pick one styling library
- Frontend is simple (hard to mess up) but it's not really responsive (horizontal scrolling)
