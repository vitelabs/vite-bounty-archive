- The frontend is made with Flutter
	- some .h, .cpp, and .dort files that I don't understand
	- This is not something we'd want to build on top of because it's a very uncommon stack for web application - first time I've ever seen a web app made from flutter
	- I would give very little credit to this, despite the effort put into it
- The contracts are not tested
- GovernorContract.solpp is slightly altered from https://docs.openzeppelin.com/contracts/4.x/governance#governor
- Contracts use ERC20 tokens
- Can't connect to demo https://esdras-santos.github.io/#/
- `vitetoken` or `tti` not mentioned once
- Reviewing this project was a waste of time
