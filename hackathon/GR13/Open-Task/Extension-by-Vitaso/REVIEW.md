- Very basic wallet
- UI doesn't specify the network type - no way to change it
	- uses wss://node-vite.thomiz.dev/ws as the endpoint
- Uses script tags instead of modules which makes reading code harder
- wallet can send and receive blocks on testnet (after changing the provider URL), so it could potentially work on mainnet as well
- Wallet can send different tokenIds
- The code is very ugly
	- `document.getElementById("walletScreen_balances").innerHTML += `\`
	- Isn't modular (will be very hard to organize as it gets more complex)
- The extension can only do basic wallet functionality and the code is ugly
