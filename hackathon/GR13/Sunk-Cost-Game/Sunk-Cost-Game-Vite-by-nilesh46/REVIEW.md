- The UI itself is basic and ugly
	- uses redux (old tech now), lots of duplicate code (e.g. `vite_signAndSendTx`)
- Test fails but I think this was supposed to
	- RuntimeError: abort(Error: done() called multiple times in test <SunkCostGame Tests Claim Reward Fail to claim Reward of already claimed Pot> of file /Users/michaelleung/repos/vite/hackathon-archive/GR13/Sunk-Cost-Game/Sunk-Cost-Game-Vite-by-nilesh46/test/test.spec.ts; in addition, done() received error: AssertionError: expected '0' to equal '1'
- Contract has an owner - not a fan of that `owner = msg.sender;`
	- `owner` can `claimFee`
	- who would want this besides a greedy owner?
