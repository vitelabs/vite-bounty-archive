- Logo is an upside down zelda trifecta
	- It's not great but at least it's not the Vite Logo unlike the other design submissions
- The pots page is very repetitive, hard to immediately distinguish won/ongoing/expired pots
- theme button has light and dark, but is missing system

Further explanation:

The design is ok. One requirement you missed was a theme option for "System" like in https://tailwindcss.com/. That aside:

Homepage:
- The logo isn't creative/unique - it's an upside triforce.
- The homepage above the fold isn't very descriptive - crypto as a whole is kind of a casino in and of itself.
- The path of triangles from the top down is kind of weird
- It's not a good idea to mix logos in with the copy
	- See "Don't do this" here: https://www.youtube.com/howyoutubeworks/resources/brand-resources/#logos-icons-and-colors
- It's white trapezoids with blue text inside look out of place on a page where every other shape is triangular.
- It's unclear how this page would respond to different screen widths.

Active pots page:
- "Active pots" in a much larger font compared to everything else looks out of place
- The "Sort by" options have no differentiation in which one is active - also might be better to put them in a dropdown.
- The logo is not needed on every card - once in the top left corner is good enough and ubiquitous among most sites
- The spacing in the pot card is very cramped - particularly around the logo, but that shouldn't be included anyways
- Inside the card, you have inconsistent font weights and colors. The hierarchy is unclear between "583.93 VITE" and "17 Contributions"
- There is very little differentiation between pots with winners and ongoing pots besides the color of the header - there could be more separation between those two types of pots
- It's really uncommon to see an editable profile page on it unless that's what the is for like ens.domains or it's a marketplace like OpenSea, but never on a dapp that's only about moving money around.
- The structure of the pot buy-in page is good, but the colors/fonts are look off - needs more hierarchy.
