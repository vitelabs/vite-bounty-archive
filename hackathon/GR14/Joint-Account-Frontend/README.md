# GR14 Hackathon - Joint Account Frontend

## Purpose
The Vite ecosystem needs a dapp for holding funds between multiple accounts. This will:
1. Protect funds of compromised accounts
2. Allow funds to only move by majority vote
3. Enable escrow services

## Features
- Anyone can create a joint account
- Joint account makers can specify who can vote and the approval threshold to move funds
- Joint accounts can hold multiple token types
- Joint account members can propose a motion to move a specific token type and amount to a specific address
- Joint account members can vote to pass the motion or not (not voting counts as rejecting the motion)
- If the approval threshold to pass the motion is met, the transfer is executed and then the motion and votes are reset
- Motions can be replaced or removed at any time by any joint account member; when this happens, votes are reset.

## Frontend Requirements
- Takes into account "Features" listed above
- Uses contract from our previous [Joint Account bounty](https://gitcoin.co/issue/28534)
