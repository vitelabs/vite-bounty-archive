# GR14 Hackathon - DAO Governance Tool

## Purpose
The Vite ecosystem needs a dapp for governing an arbitrary number of DAO projects. This will enable:
1. Decentralized on-chain/off-chain governance of DAOs
2. A single platform for users to vote in the various DAOs they're a part of
3. Increased community engagement

## Features
- Inspired by [Snapshot](https://snapshot.org/)
- Anyone can create their own DAO "space"
- Users can join a space
- Users can submit proposals to a space
- Users vote on proposals with the token specified during proposal creation
- Displays voting results for ongoing and expired polls
- Proposals are voted on via weighted voting where token holders can spread their votes over any number of options
- Voting involves locking up governance tokens in the DAO governance contract
- Proposals include a title, description, expiration date (or ongoing until a certain number of votes have been reached), token id used for voting, and optionally a contract to call with the proposal results when the proposal closes.


## Frontend Requirements
- Takes into account "Features" listed above
- Project is based off of [Vite Express](https://github.com/vitelabs/vite-express)
- Feel free to use any design aesthetic but it must be consistent throughout the whole dapp


## Contract Requirements
- Takes into account "Features" listed above
- Uses Solidity++ 0.8
- Unit tests for all contract functionality using [ViteJS](https://github.com/vitelabs/vite.js "https://github.com/vitelabs/vite.js") and/or [Vuilder](https://github.com/vitelabs/vuilder) and your unit testing library of choice.
	- Refer to [Vite Express](https://github.com/vitelabs/vite-express) for a contract testing (and frontend) template
- Contract should have functions for reading/paginating through all spaces and proposals (both ongoing and ended) for each space

## Reward
- $5000 in Vite
