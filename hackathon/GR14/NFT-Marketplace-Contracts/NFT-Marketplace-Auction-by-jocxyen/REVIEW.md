- EnglishAuctions.solpp
	- has functions for creating/canceling/bidding/ending auctions
	- has a lot of getters for frontends to display auction data
- DutchAuctions.solpp
	- `contract DutchAuctions is ReentrancyGuard` but Vite can't have re-entrancy attacks
	- placeBid does not end auction as it should
	- keeps track of lastHighestBidder for some reason
	- Looks like an altered version of EnglishAuctions.solpp but doesn't exactly do a Dutch Auction
