smart-on-fhir.com: The blockchain of electronic healthcare records via API created by a global organization hl7 and is still very new and extremely promising for all humans and getting their healthcare data and more health tech at the palm of their hands. The platform that would help open developers create apps that could utilize dapps which would be minting and spending the specific resource tokens.
Other domains which I owe are ehr-token.com (a second tier token possibly for minting or PoS), r4-token (another more specific token for obtaining the type of resource standards you want to use). hl7v2.org which would serve as the open discussion global standardization of the resources and how the tokens would interact within the blockchain. usdbits.com is another domain that could be used as a test network for conversions but that is more far-fetched.
