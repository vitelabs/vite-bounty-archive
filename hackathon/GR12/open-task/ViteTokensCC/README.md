# ViteTokensCC
ViteTokens is a faucet which gives you a random VITE token each time you redeem!<br /> 
You can have your own pool, and help distribute new tokens for just 1 VITE!
# ViteTokens Setup
To set up the faucet you need:<br /> 
• MariaDB Database running and set up with the tables<br /> 
• Node.js<br /> 
• An older version of node-fetch<br /> 
# Running it
Edit the .env file, you can obtain the WHOIS_KEY on this page: https://whois.as207111.net/<br /> 
Rest should be easy to get. Make sure to update reCaptcha secret in the .env and in the .htmls
# Test
I know these instructions are horrible and barely understanable, sorry. If you would like to test the faucet go onto https://vitetokens.cc for a fully working one.
# Todo
Currently nothing

# Dear Vite Team..
Hello, I would like to address a really important issue to you, this issue took me 1 hour to solve.<br /> 
The issue I'm talking about is your documentation, even though the look of it is great, the context is terrible. What am I talking about? Grammar errors, and most importantly code issues. <br /> The basic send function in Vite.js documentation is made incorrectly, even though it looks like an "easy fix" it may not be so easy to figure it out for a novice developer. I hope you understand the problem, let's look at this example: <br /> 
A small developer is working on an app and decides to use VITE, but after copying the function from the docs, it doesn't work. What's wrong? Well, let's assume he can't figure it out, so after a few hours of fighting he decides to use a different cryptocurrency, which has a proper documentation.<br /> <br /> 
Sincerely, me.
