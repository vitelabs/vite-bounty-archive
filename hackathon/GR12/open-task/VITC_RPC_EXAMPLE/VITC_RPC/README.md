# Banano_RPC_Tester

Uses .NET Nano RPC wrapper on Banano Network!

This allows a .net developer to talk to BANANO Blockchain!

most of this code is from Jerzy Stanislawski's DOT NANO project. He is an awesome guy and deserves 80% of the credit! I didnt even change the references of the namespace to make sure he gets most of the kudos here! He's a freakin genius! The github for that is

I did re compile them as .net framework 4.8 for windows and added a windows form project to show it works. I also changed certain parts so that it works with BANANO addresses and not NANO addresses. You should be able to download the zip, extract, open the solution file (found in the win forms directory) and run it no problem!
Dont forget to check out the NANO RPC calls to see how you need to do things here
https://docs.nano.org/commands/rpc-protocol/

I was using the banano tester node but it's been down, so the screenshots are from my personal node that I built. It should work out of the box once the banano tester node is back online!
