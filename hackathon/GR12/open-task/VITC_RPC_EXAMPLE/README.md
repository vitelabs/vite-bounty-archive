# VITC_RPC_EXAMPLE
This should provide the basics on how to set up a C# .net application to talk to a VITE node for basic tasks.  More response classes need to be made to perform other tasks but hopefully you can use this as a template to go off of. This particular example uses Vitamin Coin, but really you can use the same code for any token on the VITE network.
