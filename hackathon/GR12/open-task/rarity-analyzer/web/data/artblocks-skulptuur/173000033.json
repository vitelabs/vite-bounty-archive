{"nft":{"id":173000033,"name":"Skulptuur #33","description":"An exploration in generating forms in 3-dimensional space. This exclusive set of sculptures has been carved from a sea of infinite possibilities, much like a sculptor creates a singular reality from the potential in a block of stone. The shapes are illuminated by a variety of complex virtual lighting environments and yet the piece retains algorithmic minimalism with the code reduced to its pure essence -- 6370 bytes. Skulptuurs render in real time. In live view, the image keeps improving in quality. Keys 0-7 change speed: 0=Stop, 5=Default, 7=Fastest. Careful, requires a powerful machine. Requires a WebGL2-enabled browser.","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6nYCUwOhnjEy0Ur-1unYl-xSYktiLKw6zJu184xvBjOEQYBldro91ZAzG10fzNzvoZeAcRzV1GM8EvdWdkF9SNKAdLRZCNPYd5ZAK9s","external_url":"https://artblocks.io/token/173000033","attributes":[{"trait_type":"All Skulptuurs"},{"trait_type":"gold","value":" no"},{"trait_type":"camera_pos","value":" a bit left"},{"trait_type":"grid1","value":" 4x4"},{"trait_type":"shift","value":" yes"},{"trait_type":"shape0","value":" xdon"},{"trait_type":"shape1","value":" xdiscs"},{"trait_type":"env_shadows_type","value":" foliage"},{"trait_type":"skulptuur_height","value":" 8.8"},{"trait_type":"grid0","value":" 2x1"},{"trait_type":"environ_type","value":" shadows"},{"trait_type":"environ_name","value":" After Rain"},{"trait_type":"camera_height","value":" ground"},{"trait_type":"shells1","value":" hollow"},{"trait_type":"shells0","value":" double shell"},{"trait_type":"Trait Count","value":"15"}]},"attributeRarities":[{"trait_type":"gold","value":" no","count":990,"ratio":0.99,"ratioScore":1.0101010101010102},{"trait_type":"camera_pos","value":" a bit left","count":231,"ratio":0.231,"ratioScore":4.329004329004329},{"trait_type":"grid1","value":" 4x4","count":162,"ratio":0.162,"ratioScore":6.172839506172839},{"trait_type":"shift","value":" yes","count":482,"ratio":0.482,"ratioScore":2.074688796680498},{"trait_type":"shape0","value":" xdon","count":117,"ratio":0.117,"ratioScore":8.547008547008547},{"trait_type":"shape1","value":" xdiscs","count":133,"ratio":0.133,"ratioScore":7.518796992481203},{"trait_type":"env_shadows_type","value":" foliage","count":215,"ratio":0.215,"ratioScore":4.651162790697675},{"trait_type":"skulptuur_height","value":" 8.8","count":104,"ratio":0.104,"ratioScore":9.615384615384615},{"trait_type":"grid0","value":" 2x1","count":141,"ratio":0.141,"ratioScore":7.092198581560284},{"trait_type":"environ_type","value":" shadows","count":434,"ratio":0.434,"ratioScore":2.3041474654377883},{"trait_type":"environ_name","value":" After Rain","count":26,"ratio":0.026,"ratioScore":38.46153846153846},{"trait_type":"camera_height","value":" ground","count":380,"ratio":0.38,"ratioScore":2.6315789473684212},{"trait_type":"shells1","value":" hollow","count":324,"ratio":0.324,"ratioScore":3.0864197530864197},{"trait_type":"shells0","value":" double shell","count":343,"ratio":0.343,"ratioScore":2.9154518950437316},{"trait_type":"Trait Count","value":"15","count":1000,"ratio":1,"ratioScore":1}],"rarityScore":101.41032169156581,"rank":802}
