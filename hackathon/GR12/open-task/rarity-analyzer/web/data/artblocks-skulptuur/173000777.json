{"nft":{"id":173000777,"name":"Skulptuur #777","description":"An exploration in generating forms in 3-dimensional space. This exclusive set of sculptures has been carved from a sea of infinite possibilities, much like a sculptor creates a singular reality from the potential in a block of stone. The shapes are illuminated by a variety of complex virtual lighting environments and yet the piece retains algorithmic minimalism with the code reduced to its pure essence -- 6370 bytes. Skulptuurs render in real time. In live view, the image keeps improving in quality. Keys 0-7 change speed: 0=Stop, 5=Default, 7=Fastest. Careful, requires a powerful machine. Requires a WebGL2-enabled browser.","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/7EGukmtRv7lfBmPqHCB_sfjS5qgvMzQ-qZEjGxNXxScUuS9dFHlzjuxh91lGP-JJJPGI0YLYZ5KJlgNy0Ec7yDA70olN6XxT4Nmxp3k","external_url":"https://artblocks.io/token/173000777","attributes":[{"trait_type":"All Skulptuurs"},{"trait_type":"gold","value":" no"},{"trait_type":"shape0","value":" bal"},{"trait_type":"shift","value":" yes"},{"trait_type":"shape1","value":" ydon"},{"trait_type":"shells1","value":" double shell"},{"trait_type":"environ_type","value":" solid clouds"},{"trait_type":"environ_name","value":" Atrium Lake"},{"trait_type":"camera_height","value":" medium low"},{"trait_type":"env_shadows_type","value":" N/A"},{"trait_type":"grid0","value":" 1x1"},{"trait_type":"grid1","value":" 2x3"},{"trait_type":"camera_pos","value":" a bit right"},{"trait_type":"shells0","value":" double shell"},{"trait_type":"skulptuur_height","value":" 7.7"},{"trait_type":"Trait Count","value":"15"}]},"attributeRarities":[{"trait_type":"gold","value":" no","count":990,"ratio":0.99,"ratioScore":1.0101010101010102},{"trait_type":"shape0","value":" bal","count":126,"ratio":0.126,"ratioScore":7.936507936507937},{"trait_type":"shift","value":" yes","count":482,"ratio":0.482,"ratioScore":2.074688796680498},{"trait_type":"shape1","value":" ydon","count":123,"ratio":0.123,"ratioScore":8.130081300813009},{"trait_type":"shells1","value":" double shell","count":353,"ratio":0.353,"ratioScore":2.8328611898017},{"trait_type":"environ_type","value":" solid clouds","count":225,"ratio":0.225,"ratioScore":4.444444444444445},{"trait_type":"environ_name","value":" Atrium Lake","count":32,"ratio":0.032,"ratioScore":31.25},{"trait_type":"camera_height","value":" medium low","count":280,"ratio":0.28,"ratioScore":3.571428571428571},{"trait_type":"env_shadows_type","value":" N/A","count":566,"ratio":0.566,"ratioScore":1.76678445229682},{"trait_type":"grid0","value":" 1x1","count":169,"ratio":0.169,"ratioScore":5.9171597633136095},{"trait_type":"grid1","value":" 2x3","count":62,"ratio":0.062,"ratioScore":16.129032258064516},{"trait_type":"camera_pos","value":" a bit right","count":194,"ratio":0.194,"ratioScore":5.154639175257731},{"trait_type":"shells0","value":" double shell","count":343,"ratio":0.343,"ratioScore":2.9154518950437316},{"trait_type":"skulptuur_height","value":" 7.7","count":61,"ratio":0.061,"ratioScore":16.39344262295082},{"trait_type":"Trait Count","value":"15","count":1000,"ratio":1,"ratioScore":1}],"rarityScore":110.52662341670438,"rank":527}
