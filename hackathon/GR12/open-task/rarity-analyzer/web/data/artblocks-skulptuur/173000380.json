{"nft":{"id":173000380,"name":"Skulptuur #380","description":"An exploration in generating forms in 3-dimensional space. This exclusive set of sculptures has been carved from a sea of infinite possibilities, much like a sculptor creates a singular reality from the potential in a block of stone. The shapes are illuminated by a variety of complex virtual lighting environments and yet the piece retains algorithmic minimalism with the code reduced to its pure essence -- 6370 bytes. Skulptuurs render in real time. In live view, the image keeps improving in quality. Keys 0-7 change speed: 0=Stop, 5=Default, 7=Fastest. Careful, requires a powerful machine. Requires a WebGL2-enabled browser.","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/Wufz1ApT7ivZnPiTPE_hF9DZcnyMDHOQKOIgDZvxJhKCKQGrVurL0SPkknB01ZgewqVwRKmH_gXKLgNY2omks-XTiQLD0dAy06ng","external_url":"https://artblocks.io/token/173000380","attributes":[{"trait_type":"All Skulptuurs"},{"trait_type":"gold","value":" no"},{"trait_type":"camera_pos","value":" a bit left"},{"trait_type":"shape0","value":" box"},{"trait_type":"shape1","value":" box"},{"trait_type":"shells0","value":" solid"},{"trait_type":"environ_type","value":" shadows"},{"trait_type":"env_shadows_type","value":" city"},{"trait_type":"environ_name","value":" After Rain"},{"trait_type":"shift","value":" no"},{"trait_type":"grid0","value":" 1x1"},{"trait_type":"camera_height","value":" ground"},{"trait_type":"shells1","value":" hollow"},{"trait_type":"grid1","value":" 2x4"},{"trait_type":"skulptuur_height","value":" 7.7"},{"trait_type":"Trait Count","value":"15"}]},"attributeRarities":[{"trait_type":"gold","value":" no","count":990,"ratio":0.99,"ratioScore":1.0101010101010102},{"trait_type":"camera_pos","value":" a bit left","count":231,"ratio":0.231,"ratioScore":4.329004329004329},{"trait_type":"shape0","value":" box","count":126,"ratio":0.126,"ratioScore":7.936507936507937},{"trait_type":"shape1","value":" box","count":118,"ratio":0.118,"ratioScore":8.474576271186441},{"trait_type":"shells0","value":" solid","count":327,"ratio":0.327,"ratioScore":3.058103975535168},{"trait_type":"environ_type","value":" shadows","count":434,"ratio":0.434,"ratioScore":2.3041474654377883},{"trait_type":"env_shadows_type","value":" city","count":219,"ratio":0.219,"ratioScore":4.566210045662101},{"trait_type":"environ_name","value":" After Rain","count":26,"ratio":0.026,"ratioScore":38.46153846153846},{"trait_type":"shift","value":" no","count":518,"ratio":0.518,"ratioScore":1.9305019305019304},{"trait_type":"grid0","value":" 1x1","count":169,"ratio":0.169,"ratioScore":5.9171597633136095},{"trait_type":"camera_height","value":" ground","count":380,"ratio":0.38,"ratioScore":2.6315789473684212},{"trait_type":"shells1","value":" hollow","count":324,"ratio":0.324,"ratioScore":3.0864197530864197},{"trait_type":"grid1","value":" 2x4","count":78,"ratio":0.078,"ratioScore":12.820512820512821},{"trait_type":"skulptuur_height","value":" 7.7","count":61,"ratio":0.061,"ratioScore":16.39344262295082},{"trait_type":"Trait Count","value":"15","count":1000,"ratio":1,"ratioScore":1}],"rarityScore":113.91980533270724,"rank":438}
