{"nft":{"id":173000143,"name":"Skulptuur #143","description":"An exploration in generating forms in 3-dimensional space. This exclusive set of sculptures has been carved from a sea of infinite possibilities, much like a sculptor creates a singular reality from the potential in a block of stone. The shapes are illuminated by a variety of complex virtual lighting environments and yet the piece retains algorithmic minimalism with the code reduced to its pure essence -- 6370 bytes. Skulptuurs render in real time. In live view, the image keeps improving in quality. Keys 0-7 change speed: 0=Stop, 5=Default, 7=Fastest. Careful, requires a powerful machine. Requires a WebGL2-enabled browser.","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/6h1vgnOcVYFjDO5fRwldn1vYQ_W9i_89zhXcDW_3LZtJ0O5oFObmk2K42adHBPgy3jd10rhUeIYwpMN6ncD_Azw2idFPgFOOnTUVHA","external_url":"https://artblocks.io/token/173000143","attributes":[{"trait_type":"All Skulptuurs"},{"trait_type":"gold","value":" no"},{"trait_type":"shift","value":" yes"},{"trait_type":"shape0","value":" ydon"},{"trait_type":"grid1","value":" 4x2"},{"trait_type":"shape1","value":" ydiscs"},{"trait_type":"shells0","value":" hollow"},{"trait_type":"shells1","value":" double shell"},{"trait_type":"env_shadows_type","value":" foliage"},{"trait_type":"environ_type","value":" shadows"},{"trait_type":"environ_name","value":" After Rain"},{"trait_type":"camera_pos","value":" centre"},{"trait_type":"camera_height","value":" ground"},{"trait_type":"skulptuur_height","value":" 10.4"},{"trait_type":"grid0","value":" 1x2"},{"trait_type":"Trait Count","value":"15"}]},"attributeRarities":[{"trait_type":"gold","value":" no","count":990,"ratio":0.99,"ratioScore":1.0101010101010102},{"trait_type":"shift","value":" yes","count":482,"ratio":0.482,"ratioScore":2.074688796680498},{"trait_type":"shape0","value":" ydon","count":112,"ratio":0.112,"ratioScore":8.928571428571429},{"trait_type":"grid1","value":" 4x2","count":128,"ratio":0.128,"ratioScore":7.8125},{"trait_type":"shape1","value":" ydiscs","count":128,"ratio":0.128,"ratioScore":7.8125},{"trait_type":"shells0","value":" hollow","count":330,"ratio":0.33,"ratioScore":3.0303030303030303},{"trait_type":"shells1","value":" double shell","count":353,"ratio":0.353,"ratioScore":2.8328611898017},{"trait_type":"env_shadows_type","value":" foliage","count":215,"ratio":0.215,"ratioScore":4.651162790697675},{"trait_type":"environ_type","value":" shadows","count":434,"ratio":0.434,"ratioScore":2.3041474654377883},{"trait_type":"environ_name","value":" After Rain","count":26,"ratio":0.026,"ratioScore":38.46153846153846},{"trait_type":"camera_pos","value":" centre","count":189,"ratio":0.189,"ratioScore":5.291005291005291},{"trait_type":"camera_height","value":" ground","count":380,"ratio":0.38,"ratioScore":2.6315789473684212},{"trait_type":"skulptuur_height","value":" 10.4","count":144,"ratio":0.144,"ratioScore":6.944444444444445},{"trait_type":"grid0","value":" 1x2","count":144,"ratio":0.144,"ratioScore":6.944444444444445},{"trait_type":"Trait Count","value":"15","count":1000,"ratio":1,"ratioScore":1}],"rarityScore":101.72984730039418,"rank":795}
