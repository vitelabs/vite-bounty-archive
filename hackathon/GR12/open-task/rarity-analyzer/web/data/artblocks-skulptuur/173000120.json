{"nft":{"id":173000120,"name":"Skulptuur #120","description":"An exploration in generating forms in 3-dimensional space. This exclusive set of sculptures has been carved from a sea of infinite possibilities, much like a sculptor creates a singular reality from the potential in a block of stone. The shapes are illuminated by a variety of complex virtual lighting environments and yet the piece retains algorithmic minimalism with the code reduced to its pure essence -- 6370 bytes. Skulptuurs render in real time. In live view, the image keeps improving in quality. Keys 0-7 change speed: 0=Stop, 5=Default, 7=Fastest. Careful, requires a powerful machine. Requires a WebGL2-enabled browser.","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/kbVVUnfbCfDyLghRMo-97vt1cqDZH7mYCKNJlkcVaqiGH01iJbWnw3giG3Iq-_mfJXNhGfuvShOmcp5FTKcbRGUm5KrMGvzqTwkUFYs","external_url":"https://artblocks.io/token/173000120","attributes":[{"trait_type":"All Skulptuurs"},{"trait_type":"gold","value":" no"},{"trait_type":"camera_pos","value":" a bit left"},{"trait_type":"grid1","value":" 4x3"},{"trait_type":"shift","value":" yes"},{"trait_type":"shape0","value":" ydiscs"},{"trait_type":"shape1","value":" zdon"},{"trait_type":"skulptuur_height","value":" 8.8"},{"trait_type":"environ_type","value":" shadows"},{"trait_type":"env_shadows_type","value":" city"},{"trait_type":"environ_name","value":" After Rain"},{"trait_type":"grid0","value":" 3x3"},{"trait_type":"shells1","value":" solid"},{"trait_type":"camera_height","value":" ground"},{"trait_type":"shells0","value":" double shell"},{"trait_type":"Trait Count","value":"15"}]},"attributeRarities":[{"trait_type":"gold","value":" no","count":990,"ratio":0.99,"ratioScore":1.0101010101010102},{"trait_type":"camera_pos","value":" a bit left","count":231,"ratio":0.231,"ratioScore":4.329004329004329},{"trait_type":"grid1","value":" 4x3","count":156,"ratio":0.156,"ratioScore":6.410256410256411},{"trait_type":"shift","value":" yes","count":482,"ratio":0.482,"ratioScore":2.074688796680498},{"trait_type":"shape0","value":" ydiscs","count":132,"ratio":0.132,"ratioScore":7.575757575757575},{"trait_type":"shape1","value":" zdon","count":103,"ratio":0.103,"ratioScore":9.708737864077671},{"trait_type":"skulptuur_height","value":" 8.8","count":104,"ratio":0.104,"ratioScore":9.615384615384615},{"trait_type":"environ_type","value":" shadows","count":434,"ratio":0.434,"ratioScore":2.3041474654377883},{"trait_type":"env_shadows_type","value":" city","count":219,"ratio":0.219,"ratioScore":4.566210045662101},{"trait_type":"environ_name","value":" After Rain","count":26,"ratio":0.026,"ratioScore":38.46153846153846},{"trait_type":"grid0","value":" 3x3","count":54,"ratio":0.054,"ratioScore":18.51851851851852},{"trait_type":"shells1","value":" solid","count":323,"ratio":0.323,"ratioScore":3.095975232198142},{"trait_type":"camera_height","value":" ground","count":380,"ratio":0.38,"ratioScore":2.6315789473684212},{"trait_type":"shells0","value":" double shell","count":343,"ratio":0.343,"ratioScore":2.9154518950437316},{"trait_type":"Trait Count","value":"15","count":1000,"ratio":1,"ratioScore":1}],"rarityScore":114.21735116702926,"rank":430}
