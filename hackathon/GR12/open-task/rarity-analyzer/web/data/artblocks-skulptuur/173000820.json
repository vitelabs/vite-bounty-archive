{"nft":{"id":173000820,"name":"Skulptuur #820","description":"An exploration in generating forms in 3-dimensional space. This exclusive set of sculptures has been carved from a sea of infinite possibilities, much like a sculptor creates a singular reality from the potential in a block of stone. The shapes are illuminated by a variety of complex virtual lighting environments and yet the piece retains algorithmic minimalism with the code reduced to its pure essence -- 6370 bytes. Skulptuurs render in real time. In live view, the image keeps improving in quality. Keys 0-7 change speed: 0=Stop, 5=Default, 7=Fastest. Careful, requires a powerful machine. Requires a WebGL2-enabled browser.","image":"https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/cjfNUvwL7CBcRQ0_Hx53H-Vt327Vb0twRDdlDRdsmSfDcesw6PDMYpmED46_LZLaR9JoMkPs906ilDPt2L24pJ44_ejOB-4nNv6Y","external_url":"https://artblocks.io/token/173000820","attributes":[{"trait_type":"All Skulptuurs"},{"trait_type":"gold","value":" no"},{"trait_type":"grid1","value":" 4x3"},{"trait_type":"shift","value":" yes"},{"trait_type":"shape0","value":" ydon"},{"trait_type":"shells0","value":" hollow"},{"trait_type":"camera_pos","value":" left"},{"trait_type":"skulptuur_height","value":" 8.8"},{"trait_type":"environ_type","value":" shadows"},{"trait_type":"env_shadows_type","value":" city"},{"trait_type":"environ_name","value":" After Rain"},{"trait_type":"grid0","value":" 3x3"},{"trait_type":"camera_height","value":" ground"},{"trait_type":"shape1","value":" xdon"},{"trait_type":"shells1","value":" hollow"},{"trait_type":"Trait Count","value":"15"}]},"attributeRarities":[{"trait_type":"gold","value":" no","count":990,"ratio":0.99,"ratioScore":1.0101010101010102},{"trait_type":"grid1","value":" 4x3","count":156,"ratio":0.156,"ratioScore":6.410256410256411},{"trait_type":"shift","value":" yes","count":482,"ratio":0.482,"ratioScore":2.074688796680498},{"trait_type":"shape0","value":" ydon","count":112,"ratio":0.112,"ratioScore":8.928571428571429},{"trait_type":"shells0","value":" hollow","count":330,"ratio":0.33,"ratioScore":3.0303030303030303},{"trait_type":"camera_pos","value":" left","count":207,"ratio":0.207,"ratioScore":4.830917874396135},{"trait_type":"skulptuur_height","value":" 8.8","count":104,"ratio":0.104,"ratioScore":9.615384615384615},{"trait_type":"environ_type","value":" shadows","count":434,"ratio":0.434,"ratioScore":2.3041474654377883},{"trait_type":"env_shadows_type","value":" city","count":219,"ratio":0.219,"ratioScore":4.566210045662101},{"trait_type":"environ_name","value":" After Rain","count":26,"ratio":0.026,"ratioScore":38.46153846153846},{"trait_type":"grid0","value":" 3x3","count":54,"ratio":0.054,"ratioScore":18.51851851851852},{"trait_type":"camera_height","value":" ground","count":380,"ratio":0.38,"ratioScore":2.6315789473684212},{"trait_type":"shape1","value":" xdon","count":143,"ratio":0.143,"ratioScore":6.993006993006993},{"trait_type":"shells1","value":" hollow","count":324,"ratio":0.324,"ratioScore":3.0864197530864197},{"trait_type":"Trait Count","value":"15","count":1000,"ratio":1,"ratioScore":1}],"rarityScore":113.46164335031183,"rank":449}
