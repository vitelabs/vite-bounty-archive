# nftcontract

This contract was mainly for me as a fun way to learn soliditypp, I am quite new to programming, so I apologize in advance for probably not doing this in the proper way.

Youtube demo and explanation: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fvbcjYTyLVM&t=604s

test contract on testnet without any restrictions on who can mint to try interacting:

(note that stakeforquota function is not available since it does not compile in vscode, so the contract cant stake quota for itself in the way it should, in this version.)
